    Hi, I'm Shahd, a third-year computer science student at Birzeit University. My journey in computer science has been fueled by a deep love for coding and an eagerness to learn new concepts, especially in the areas of computer systems and data structures. With each project and challenge, I enjoy delving deeper into the intricacies of technology, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.
